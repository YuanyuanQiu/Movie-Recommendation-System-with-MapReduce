# Movie-Recommendation-System-with-MapReduce
MapReduce is a programming model proposed by Google for processing and generating large data sets. Authors use this model to build a Movie Recommendation System. This system will use Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF) which is based on the similarity between movies calculated using people's ratings of those movies. Using IBCF to find similarities between movies will operate a large number of computations and it will be time consuming. MapReduce could improve the computation efficiency greatly by its parallel distributed algorithm. This work efficiency improvement of the system will be proved by comparing the run time between systems with and without using MapReduce.
